<!--- Adapty SDK 3.4.0 is a major release that introduces improvements that require migration steps on your end. ---> 

No changes are needed in your mobile app code. However, you must update your fallback paywall files to ensure compatibility with the new SDK version:

1. [Download the updated fallback paywall files](fallback-paywalls#download-fallback-paywalls-as-a-file-in-the-adapty-dashboard) from the Adapty Dashboard.
2. [Replace the existing fallback paywalls in your mobile app](ios-use-fallback-paywalls) with the new files.
