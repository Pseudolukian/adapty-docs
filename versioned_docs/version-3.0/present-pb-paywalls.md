If you've customized a paywall using the Paywall Builder, you don't need to worry about rendering it in your mobile app code to display it to the user. Such a paywall contains both what should be shown within the paywall and how it should be shown.

For detailed guidance on presenting paywalls within different frameworks, please refer to the specified topics on each framework:

- [iOS - Present paywalls](ios-present-paywalls)
- [Android - Present paywalls](android-present-paywalls)

:::warning
The new Paywall Builder is available for iOS and Android only and requires Adapty SDK v3.0 or later. For presenting paywalls in Adapty SDK v2 designed with legacy Paywall Builder, see [Display paywalls designed with legacy Paywall Builder](present-pb-paywalls).
