A paywall is an in-app storefront where customers can see and purchase products within your mobile app. Typically, paywalls are fetched from the server when a customer accesses them. 

Adapty allows you to define fallback paywalls for the situations when a user opens the app without a connection to the Adapty backend (e.g., no internet connection or in the rare case of backend unavailability) and there's no cache on the device.

Adapty generates fallbacks as a JSON file in the necessary format, reflecting the default (English) versions of the paywalls you've configured in the Adapty Dashboard. Simply download the file - one per app store, place it alongside your app on the user's device, and pass its contents to the `.setFallbackPaywalls` method, following the instructions outlined below.

   1. [Create products](create-product) you want to sell.
2. [Create paywalls and add the products to the paywalls](create-paywall). Paywalls are in-app stores in your mobile apps.
3. [Create placements and add paywalls to the placements](create-placement). Placement is the location where the paywall will be shown.
</details>

To download the JSON file with the fallback paywalls:

1. Open the **[Paywalls and Products](https://app.adapty.io/products)** section from the Adapty main menu, then select the **Products** tab or just the **[Placements](https://app.adapty.io/placements)** section in the Adapty main menu.

    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}

2. In the **Products** or **Placements** window, click the **Fallbacks** button. In both cases, you will get the same file. [Use its contents in the `fallback_paywalls` method in your mobile app code](use-fallback-paywalls).
