Offers in the App Store and Google Play are special deals or discounts provided by these platforms for in-app purchases.

To make an offer visible and selectable within a [paywall](paywalls) for your app's users, follow these steps:

1. While [configuring the products on a paywall](create-paywall), choose an offer you [created earlier](create-offer) for this product from the **Offer** list. The list is available only for the products that have offers.
