A [Placement](placements) designates a specific location within your mobile app where a paywall or A/B test can be displayed. For example, a subscription choice might appear in a startup flow, while a consumable product (such as golden coins) could be presented when a user runs out of coins in a game. You have the flexibility to showcase the same paywall or A/B test across multiple placements or different paywalls or A/B tests in one placement for different user segments, called audiences in Adapty.

To edit an existing placement:

1. Open the **[Placements](https://app.adapty.io/placements)** section in Adapty main menu.

2. In the **Placements** window, click the **3-dot** button next to the placement and select the **Edit** option.
