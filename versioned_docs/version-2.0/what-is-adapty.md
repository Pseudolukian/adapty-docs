Whether you're just starting or already have millions of users, Adapty makes it easy to set up the best subscription prices, test different approaches, and see what works best for your app's success.

### Marketing automation and testing

- Subscriptions/in-app purchases SDK for [iOS](ios-installation), [Android](android-installation), [Flutter](flutter-installation), [React Native](react-native-installation) and [Unity](unity-installation). Adapty performs server-side receipt validation for you and syncs your customers across all platforms, including [web](getting-started-with-server-side-api). It also works in [observer](observer-vs-full-mode) mode, so you can use SDK without changing your existing purchase infrastructure.
- [A/B testing](ab-test) for subscription plans. Test different prices, durations, trial periods for your subscriptions as well as different visual elements.
- [Analytics](analytics-charts) for the app economy. Detailed metrics related to your app monetization.
- Adapty can send [subscription events](events) to 3rd party analytics: [Amplitude](amplitude), [AppsFlyer](appsflyer), [Adjust](adjust), [Branch](branch), [Mixpanel](mixpanel), [Facebook Ads](facebook-ads), [AppMetrica](appmetrica), and custom [Webhook](webhook).

### Adapty works for developers, marketers, and executives

Marketers can directly engage users with promotional offers to return them to the service or upsell new products. With Adapty there is no need for programmers and analysts to manually extract segments.

For product managers and executives, Adapty has a dashboard with viable subscription metrics with daily/weekly/monthly reports to Slack and Emails.
