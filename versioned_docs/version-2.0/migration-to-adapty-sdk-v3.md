Adapty SDK v.3.0 brings support for the new exciting [Adapty Paywall Builder](/3.0/adapty-paywall-builder), the new version of the no-code user-friendly tool to create paywalls. With its maximum flexibility and rich design capabilities, your paywalls will become most effective and profitable.

Upgrade to new Paywall Builder consists of:

1. Upgrade to Adapty SDK v3.x via Swift Package Manager or via CocoaPods.
2. Migrate your paywalls to new Paywall Builder.

## Reinstall Adapty SDK v3.x via Swift Package Manager

1. Delete AdaptyUI SDK package dependency from your project, you won't need it anymore.
2. Even though you have it already, you'll need to re-add the Adapty SDK dependency. For this, in Xcode, open **File** ->  **Add Package Dependency...**. Please note the way to add package dependencies can differ in XCode versions. Refer to XCode documentation if necessary.
3. Enter the repository URL `https://github.com/adaptyteam/AdaptySDK-iOS.git`
4. Choose the version, and click the **Add package** button. 
5. Choose the modules you need:
   1. **Adapty** is the mandatory module
   2. **AdaptyUI** is an optional module you need if you plan to use the [Adapty Paywall Builder](/3.0/adapty-paywall-builder).
6. Xcode will add the package dependency to your project, and you can import it. For this, in the **Choose Package Products** window, click the **Add package** button once again. The package will appear in the **Packages** list.

## Reinstall Adapty SDK v3.x via CocoaPods

Change your `Podfile` to fir the new Adapty SDK version:

1. ```shell title="Podfile"
   pod 'Adapty', '~> 3.0.0-beta.1'
   pod 'AdaptyUI', '~> 3.0.0-beta.1'
   ```

2. Run:

   ```sh title="Shell"
   pod install
   ```

This creates a `.xcworkspace` file for your app. Use this file for all future development of your application.

Activate Adapty and AdaptyUI SDK. Before v3.0, you did not activate AdaptyUI, remember to **add AdaptyUI activation**. Parameters are not changes, so keep them as is. 

```swift title="Swift"
// In your AppDelegate class:
import Adapty
import AdaptyUI // Only if you are going to use AdaptyUI

let configurationBuilder =
	Adapty.Configuration
		.Builder(withAPIKey: "PUBLIC_SDK_KEY")
		.with(observerMode: false)
		.with(customerUserId: "YOUR_USER_ID")
		.with(idfaCollectionDisabled: false)
		.with(ipAddressCollectionDisabled: false)

Adapty.activate(with: configurationBuilder) { error in
  // handle the error
}

// Only if you are going to use AdaptyUI
AdaptyUI.activate()
```
```swift title="SwiftUI"
import Adapty
import AdaptyUI // Only if you are going to use AdaptyUI

@main
struct SampleApp: App {
    init() 
      let configurationBuilder =
        Adapty.Configuration
          .Builder(withAPIKey: "PUBLIC_SDK_KEY")
          .with(observerMode: false) // optional
          .with(customerUserId: "YOUR_USER_ID") // optional
          .with(idfaCollectionDisabled: false) // optional
          .with(ipAddressCollectionDisabled: false) // optional

        Adapty.activate(with: configurationBuilder) { error in
          // handle the error
        }
			  
  			// Only if you are going to use AdaptyUI
				AdaptyUI.activate()
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

## Migrate your paywalls to new Paywall Builder

Starting with Adapty SDK v3.x, legacy Paywall Builder paywalls are no longer supported. [Migrate your existing legacy Paywall Builder paywalls](migration-to-new-paywall-builder) to the new Paywall Builder, one at a time. During this migration, Adapty will create a new version of each paywall that is compatible with the updated Paywall Builder. The old version, compatible with the legacy Paywall Builder, will remain unchanged, so users with app versions using Adapty SDK v2.x or earlier will still see their paywalls as before.

Paywalls designed without using a Paywall Builder are not affected.
