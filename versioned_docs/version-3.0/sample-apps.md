To help you get started with Adapty SDK, we've prepared sample apps that demonstrate how to integrate and use its key features. These apps provide ready-to-use implementations of paywalls, purchases, and analytics tracking.

<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/adapty-scheme.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: 'none', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

### Why use sample apps?

- **Quick Integration:** See how Adapty SDK works in a real app.
- **Best Practices:** Follow recommended implementation patterns.
- **Debugging & Testing:** Use the sample apps to troubleshoot and experiment before integrating Adapty into your own project.
