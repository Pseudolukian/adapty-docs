[AppsFlyer](https://www.appsflyer.com/) is a leading platform for mobile attribution and marketing analytics. It stands as a third-party service that gathers and organizes data from marketing campaigns. This helps you see how well your campaigns are performing in one place.

Integrating Adapty with AppsFlyer allows app developers and marketers to close the gap between user acquisition data and revenue analytics. This integration is essential for accurately attributing app installs and user actions to various marketing campaigns and channels.

By forwarding [subscription events](events) to Appsflyer, you can see exactly where conversions come from and which campaigns bring in the most value across all channels, platforms, and devices. Essentially, Appsflyerâ€™s dashboards offer advanced analytics for marketing campaigns.

By forwarding AppsFlyer attribution to Adapty, you enrich the Adapty analytics with additional filtration criteria you can use in cohort and conversion analysis.

The integration between Adapty and AppsFlyer operates in two main ways.

1. **Receiving attribution data from AppsFlyer**  
   Once you've set up the AppsFlyer integration, Adapty will start receiving attribution data from AppsFlyer. You can easily access and view this data on the user's profile page.

  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>





2. **Sending subscription events to AppsFlyer**  
     Adapty can send all subscription events that are configured in your integration to AppsFlyer. As a result, you'll be able to track these events within the AppsFlyer dashboard. This integration is beneficial for evaluating the effectiveness of your advertising campaigns.
