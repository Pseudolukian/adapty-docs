A webhook is a convenient and fast way to get notifications about [events](events). For example, if a new trial is started, a subscription is renewed, or a billing issue happens. The webhook mechanism works through a callback function. You set up a URL (called Endpoint URL) to which an HTTP request is sent when an event occurs. 


<img
  src={require('./img/e5dce30-image_3.png').default}
  style={{
    border: 'none', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>





Unlike API requests, which require repeatedly requesting information from the server, a webhook is configured only once. When the target event occurs in your app, it immediately sends data via the HTTP protocol.

With webhooks integrated, you can:

- Keep track of subscriptions and purchases in your backend system.
- Automate processes and workflows based on subscription lifecycles.
- Engage with subscribers by reminding them of app benefits, addressing unsubscribe decisions, and handling billing issues.
- Conduct a detailed analysis of the user behavior.

**Integration characteristics**

| Integration characteristic | Description                                                 |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Schedule                   | Real-time updates                                           |
| Data direction             | One-way data transmission: from Adapty to your server       |
| Adapty integration flow    | Events are sent by the Adapty server once they are received |

## Events sent to web hook

| Event Name | Description |
|----------|-----------|
| **subscription_started** | A user has activated a subscription without a trial period i.e. he was billed instantly. |
| **subscription_renewed** | A subscription was renewed and the user was charged. For both trial and non-trial subscriptions, this event is sent starting from the second billing. |
| **subscription_expired** | A user has canceled a subscription and it is completely finished, that is  the user has no longer access to the premium features of the app. When the user unsubscribes, subscription_renewal_cancelled event is sent. |
| **trial_started** | A user has activated a trial subscription. |
| **trial_converted** | A trial period has ended and the user was billed, i.e. first purchase was made. |
| **trial_expired** | <p>A trial has expired without converting to a subscription and the user has no longer access to the premium features of the app.</p><p>When the user cancels a trial, trial_renewal_cancelled event is sent.</p> |
| **non_subscription_purchase** | Any non-subscription purchase e.g. lifetime access or consumable product such as coins. |
| **billing_issue_detected** | An attempt to charge the user was made, but a billing issue happened. Usually, it means the user doesn't have enough card balance. |
| **entered_grace_period** | The payment was not successful and the user entered into a grace period. The user still has access to the premium features of your app until the grace period is finished. |
| **trial_renewal_cancelled** | A user turned off subscription auto-renewal during the trial. A user still has access to the premium features of your app until the end of the trial period. |
| **trial_renewal_reactivated** | A user turned on subscription auto-renewal during the trial period. |
| **subscription_renewal_cancelled** | A user turned off subscription auto-renewal. A user still has access to the premium features of your app until the end of the subscription period. |
| **subscription_renewal_reactivated** | A user turned on subscription auto-renewal. |
| **subscription_refunded** | A subscription was refunded \(e.g. by Apple support\). |
| **non_subscription_purchase_refunded** | Non-subscription purchase was refunded. |
| **subscription_paused** | User activated [subscription pause](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/subs#pause) (Android only). |
| **subscription_deferred** | A user's subscription has been deferred, ie they were granted free usage time (Android only). Usually, it happens in response to an [API](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/rest/v3/purchases.subscriptions/defer) call from your servers. |
| **access_level_updated** | User's access level updated. |


:::note
**SUBSCRIPTION\_EXPIRED**(previously **SUBSCRIPTION\_CANCELED**) event means that the subscription completely finished and the user has no longer access to the premium features of the app. When the user unsubscribes, **AUTO\_RENEW\_OFF** or **AUTO\_RENEW\_OFF\_SUBSCRIPTION** is sent. The same logic applied to **TRIAL\_CANCELLED.**

## Webhook event structure

Adapty will send you those events you've chosen in the **Events names** section of the [**Integrations** ->  **Webhooks**](https://app.adapty.io/integrations/customwebhook) page.

Each event except for the [access_level_update](webhook#event-access-level-updated) is wrapped into the structure before. Please pay attention that some properties can be absent, if a property field is blank, Adapty does not sent it to webhook.

:::

Webhook integration enables the control of sending attribution and user attributes. 

- Enable the **Send Attribution** option in the [**Integrations** ->  **Webhooks**](https://app.adapty.io/integrations/customwebhook) page to send the information about the source of app installs from data providers. 
- Enable the **Send User Attributes** option to send custom user attributes set up from the Adapty SDK, such as user preferences and app usage data.

## Access level updated event

Adapty has a special event `access_level_updated`. It is sent only to webhook integration every time the access level is updated/set for a specific customer. Use this event to update a customer's subscription in your database/system. No matter what was the source of access level changes, you will always receive a dedicated event for that, therefore it's more precise and has more details than `subscription_renewed`, `trial_started`, `entered_grace_period`, etc.
