As you dive into Adapty and fine-tune your paywall settings, you might accumulate paywalls that no longer fit your current strategy or campaigns. These unused paywalls, left `Inactive`, can clutter your workspace, making it tricky to find the ones that matter most. To tackle this, Adapty introduces the option to archive these unnecessary paywalls. 

Archiving ensures they're safely stored without permanent deletion, ready to be accessed if needed in the future. Plus, archived paywalls can be filtered out from the default view, decluttering your workspace and simplifying your user interface. In this guide, we'll walk you through efficiently archiving paywalls in Adapty, giving you greater control over your paywall management process.

Just a friendly reminder: Live paywalls that are currently active in at least one placement cannot be archived. If you wish to archive such a paywall, simply remove it from all placements beforehand.

**To archive a paywall:**

1. Open the [**Products and Paywalls**](https://app.adapty.io/paywalls) section in the Adapty main menu and click the **Paywall** tab to open it.

  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





2. Click the **3-dot** button next to the paywall and select the **Archive** option.

    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>



3. When you're in the **Archive paywall** window, simply type in the name of the paywall you wish to archive and then click the **Archive** button.
