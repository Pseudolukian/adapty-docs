Offers in the App Store and Google Play are special deals or discounts provided by these platforms for in-app purchases.

To make an offer visible and selectable within a [paywall](paywalls) for your app's users, follow these steps:

1. While [configuring the products on a paywall](create-paywall), click the **Add offer** button next to the product the offer belongs to. The button is available only for the products that have offers.

   
<img
  src={require('./img/3a727c2-add_offer_to_paywall.png').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>



2. Select an offer you [created earlier](create-offer) for this product from the **Offer** list.


<img
  src={require('./img/8eab55a-add_offer_to_paywall_2.png').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
