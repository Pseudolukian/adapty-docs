import Zoom from 'react-medium-image-zoom';
import 'react-medium-image-zoom/dist/styles.css';

To send push notifications you have to enter Firebase Cloud Messaging \(FCM\) **server key** in Adapty dashboard. Open Firebase, choose the app you want to use, go to **Project Settings > Cloud Messaging**, and copy the server key. If you don't have one you can create it by clicking the Add server key button in the right top corner.
