Adapty is a powerful and adaptable in-app purchase platform that helps you grow your subscriber base. Whether you're just starting or already have millions of users, Adapty makes it easy to set up the best subscription prices, test different approaches, and see what works best for your app's success.

### Marketing automation and testing

- Subscriptions/in-app purchases SDK for [iOS](sdk-installation-ios), [Android](sdk-installation-android), [Flutter](sdk-installation-flutter), [React Native](sdk-installation-reactnative) and [Unity](sdk-installation-unity). Adapty performs server-side receipt validation for you and syncs your customers across all platforms, including [web](getting-started-with-server-side-api). It also works in [Observer mode](observer-vs-full-mode), so you can use SDK without changing your existing purchase infrastructure.
- [A/B testing](ab-test) for subscription plans. Test different prices, durations, trial periods for your subscriptions as well as different visual elements.
- [Analytics](analytics-charts) for the app economy. Detailed metrics related to your app monetization.
- Adapty can send [subscription events](events) to 3rd party analytics: [Amplitude](amplitude), [AppsFlyer](appsflyer), [Adjust](adjust), [Branch](branch), [Mixpanel](mixpanel), [Facebook Ads](facebook-ads), [AppMetrica](appmetrica), and custom [Webhook](webhook).
