If you've customized a paywall using the Paywall Builder, you don't need to worry about rendering it in your mobile app code to display it to the user. Such a paywall contains both what should be shown within the paywall and how it should be shown.

For detailed guidance on presenting paywalls within different frameworks, please refer to the specified topics on each framework:

- [iOS - Present paywalls](ios-present-paywalls)
- [Android - Present paywalls](android-present-paywalls)
- [React Native - Present paywalls](react-native-present-paywalls)

:::warning

This guide covers the process for **new Paywall Builder paywalls** only. The new Paywall Builder is currently supported only on iO, Android, and React Native, as it requires SDK v3.0, which is available for iOS and Android only. Support for Flutter, and Unity is coming soon.

- For presenting **legacy Paywall Builder paywalls**, check out [Present legacy Paywall Builder paywalls and their configuration](present-legacy-pb-paywalls).

- For presenting **remote config paywalls**, see [Render paywall designed by remote config](present-remote-config-paywalls).
- For presenting observer mode paywalls, see [Implement Observer mode](implement-observer-mode).
