Adapty's API lets you access and modify your Adapty data programmatically. We also support [webhooks](webhook), where we notify your server of events as they happen.

This API enables you to seamlessly integrate Adapty with your existing services.



## Authorization

- **Base URL**: https://api.adapty.io/api/v1/server-side-api/
- **Authorization header**: API requests must be authenticated by including your secret API key as **Authorization** header with value `Api-Key {secret_token}` to each request, for example, `Api-Key secret_live_BEHrYLTr.ce5zuDEWz06lFRNiaJC8mrLtL8fUwswD`. You can find your secret API key in [Adapty Dashboard -> **App Settings** -> **General** tab API -> **API keys** section](https://app.adapty.io/settings/general). This key is secret, so be careful not to share it publicly.

- **Content-Type header**: The API expects the request to use the **Content-Type** header set to `application/json`.
- **Header**: One of the following parameters:
  - **adapty-profile-id**: The ID of your user's profile. You can see it in the **Adapty ID** field on the Adapty Dashboard -> [**Profiles**](https://app.adapty.io/profiles/users) -> specific profile page.
  - **adapty-customer-user-id**: The ID of your user in your system. You can see it in the **Customer user ID** field on the Adapty Dashboard -> [**Profiles**](https://app.adapty.io/profiles/users) -> specific profile page. It will work only if you [identify the users](identifying-users) in your mobile app code via Adapty SDK.

- **Body**:  The API expects the request to use the body as JSON.
