If you've customized a paywall using the Paywall Builder, you don't need to worry about rendering it in your mobile app code to display it to the user. Such a paywall contains both what should be shown within the paywall and how it should be shown.

:::warning

This guide is for **new Paywall Builder paywalls** only which require SDK v3.2.0 or later. The process for presenting paywalls differs for paywalls designed with different versions of Paywall Builde and remote config paywalls.

- For presenting **Legacy Paywall Builder paywalls**, check out [Flutter - Present legacy Paywall Builder paywalls](flutter-present-paywalls-legacy).
- For presenting **Remote config paywalls**, see [Render paywall designed by remote config](present-remote-config-paywalls).

:::

To show a paywall, call `view.present()` method. You can use `view` from the previous step, we will introduce a new one for visibility reasons:

```typescript title="Flutter"
try {
  await view.present();
} on AdaptyError catch (e) {
  // handle the error
} catch (e) {
  // handle the error
}
```

## Using developer-defined timers

To use developer-defined timers in your mobile app, create a `timerResolver` object—a dictionary or map that pairs custom timers with the string values that will replace them when the paywall is rendered. Here's an example:

```typescript title="Flutter"
try {
      final view = await AdaptyUI().createPaywallView(
        paywall: paywall,
        customTags: ...,
        customTimers: {
          'CUSTOM_TIMER_6H': DateTime.now().add(const Duration(seconds: 3600 * 6)),
          'CUSTOM_TIMER_NY': DateTime(2025, 1, 1), // New Year 2025
        },
        preloadProducts: ...,
      );
    } on AdaptyError catch (e) {
      // handle the error
    } catch (e) {
      // handle the error
    }
```

In this example, `CUSTOM_TIMER_NY` and `CUSTOM_TIMER_6H` are the **Timer ID**s of developer-defined timers you set in the Adapty Dashboard. The `timerResolver` ensures your app dynamically updates each timer with the correct value—for example:

- `CUSTOM_TIMER_NY`: The time remaining until the timer’s end, such as New Year’s Day.
- `CUSTOM_TIMER_6H`: The time left in a 6-hour period that started when the user opened the paywall.
