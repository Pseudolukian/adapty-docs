Adapty SDK comprises two crucial modules for seamless integration into your mobile app:

- Core **Adapty**: This is a fundamental, mandatory SDK necessary for the proper functioning of Adapty within your app.
- **AdaptyUI**: This optional module becomes necessary if you use the Adapty Paywall builder: a user-friendly, no-code tool for easily creating cross-platform paywalls. These paywalls are built in a visual constructor right in our dashboard, run entirely natively on the device, and require minimal effort from you to create something that performs well.

You can install AdaptySDK via CocoaPods, or Swift Package Manager.

Go through release checklist before releasing your app

Before releasing your application, make sure to carefully review the [Release Checklist](release-checklist) thoroughly. This checklist ensures that you've completed all necessary steps and provides criteria for evaluating the success of your integration.
:::

## Install Adapty SDK via Swift Package Manager

1. In Xcode go to **File** ->  **Add Package Dependency...**. Please note the way to add package dependencies can differ in XCode versions. Refer to XCode documentation if necessary.
2. Enter the repository URL `https://github.com/adaptyteam/AdaptySDK-iOS.git`
3. Choose the version, and click the **Add package** button. 
4. Choose the modules you need:
   1. **Adapty** is the mandatory module
   2. **AdaptyUI** is an optional module you need if you plan to use the [Adapty Paywall Builder](adapty-paywall-builder).
5. Xcode will add the package dependency to your project, and you can import it. For this, in the **Choose Package Products** window, click the **Add package** button once again. The package will appear in the **Packages** list.

## Install SDKs via CocoaPods

1. Add Adapty to your `Podfile`:

   ```shell title="Podfile"
   pod 'Adapty', '~> 3.0.0-beta.1'
   pod 'AdaptyUI', '~> 3.0.0-beta.1' # optional module needed only for Paywall Builder
   ```

2. Run:

   ```sh title="Shell"
   pod install
   ```

This creates a `.xcworkspace` file for your app. Use this file for all future development of your application.

## Configure Adapty SDK

You only need to configure the Adapty SDK once, typically early in your application lifecycle:

```swift title="Swift"
// In your AppDelegate class:
import Adapty

let configurationBuilder =
	Adapty.Configuration
		.Builder(withAPIKey: "PUBLIC_SDK_KEY")
		.with(observerMode: false)
		.with(customerUserId: "YOUR_USER_ID")
		.with(idfaCollectionDisabled: false)
		.with(ipAddressCollectionDisabled: false)

Adapty.activate(with: configurationBuilder) { error in
  // handle the error
}

```
```swift title="SwiftUI"
import Adapty

@main
struct SampleApp: App {
    init() 
      let configurationBuilder =
        Adapty.Configuration
          .Builder(withAPIKey: "PUBLIC_SDK_KEY")
          .with(observerMode: false) // optional
          .with(customerUserId: "YOUR_USER_ID") // optional
          .with(idfaCollectionDisabled: false) // optional
          .with(ipAddressCollectionDisabled: false) // optional

        Adapty.activate(with: configurationBuilder) { error in
          // handle the error
        }
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

Parameters:

| Parameter | Presence | Description |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **PUBLIC_SDK_KEY** | required | The key you can find in the **Public SDK key** field of your app settings in Adapty: [**App settings**-> **General** tab -> **API keys** subsection](https://app.adapty.io/settings/general) |
| **observerMode** | optional | <p>A boolean value controlling [Observer mode](observer-vs-full-mode). Turn it on if you handle purchases and subscription status yourself and use Adapty for sending subscription events and analytics.</p><p>The default value is `false`.</p><p></p><p>ðŸš§ When running in Observer mode, Adapty SDK won't close any transactions, so make sure you're handling it.</p> |
| **customerUserId** | optional | An identifier of the user in your system. We send it in subscription and analytical events, to attribute events to the right profile. You can also find customers by `customerUserId` in the [**Profiles and Segments**](https://app.adapty.io/profiles/users) menu. |
| **idfaCollectionDisabled** | optional | <p>Set to `true` to disable IDFA collection and sharing.</p><p>the user IP address sharing.</p><p>The default value is `false`.</p><p>For more details on IDFA collection, refer to the [Analytics integration](analytics-integration#ios)   section.</p> |
| **ipAddressCollectionDisabled** | optional | <p>Set to `true` to disable user IP address collection and sharing.</p><p>The default value is `false`.</p> |


:::note
- Note, that StoreKit 2 is available since iOS 15.0. Adapty will implement the legacy logic for older versions.
- Make sure you use the **Public SDK key** for Adapty initialization, the **Secret key** should be used for [server-side API](getting-started-with-server-side-api) only.
- **SDK keys** are unique for every app, so if you have multiple apps make sure you choose the right one.
:::

Please keep in mind that for paywalls and products to be displayed in your mobile application, and for analytics to work, you need to [display the paywalls](display-pb-paywalls) and, if you're using paywalls not created with the Paywall Builder, [handle the purchase process](making-purchases) within your app.

## Configure AdaptyUI

You need to configure the AdaptyUI only if you plan to use [Paywall Builder](display-pb-paywalls) and have [installed AdaptyUI](sdk-installation-ios#install-adapty-sdk-via-swift-package-manager):

```swift title="Swift"
import AdaptyUI // Only if you are going to use AdaptyUI

// After calling Adapty.activate()
        let adaptyUIConfiguration = AdaptyUI.Configuration(
            mediaCacheConfiguration: .init(
                memoryStorageTotalCostLimit: 100 * 1024 * 1024,
                memoryStorageCountLimit: .max,
                diskStorageSizeLimit: 100 * 1024 * 1024
            )
        )
        AdaptyUI.activate(
            configuration: adaptyUIConfiguration
        )
```

Please note that AdaptyUI configuration is optional, you can activate AdaptyUI without its config. However, if you use the config, all parameters are required in it.

Parameters:

| Parameter                   | Presence | Description                                                            |
| :-------------------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| memoryStorageTotalCostLimit | required | Total cost limit of the storage in bytes.                              |
| memoryStorageCountLimit     | required | The item count limit of the memory storage.                            |
| diskStorageSizeLimit        | required | The file size limit on disk of the storage in bytes. 0 means no limit. |

## Set up the logging system

Adapty logs errors and other crucial information to provide insight into your app's functionality. There are the following available levels:

| Level   | Description                                                                                                                 |
| :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| error   | Only errors will be logged.                                                                                                 |
| warn    | Errors and messages from the SDK that do not cause critical errors, but are worth paying attention to will be logged.       |
| info    | Errors, warnings, and serious information messages, such as those that log the lifecycle of various modules will be logged. |
| verbose | Any additional information that may be useful during debugging, such as function calls, API queries, etc. will be logged.   |

You can set `logLevel` at any time in the application's lifespan, but we recommend that you do this before configuring Adapty.

```swift title="Swift"
Adapty.logLevel = .verbose
```

## Redirect the logging system messages

If you for some reason need to send messages from Adapty to your system or save them to a file, you can override the default behavior:

```swift title="Swift"
Adapty.setLogHandler { level, message in
    writeToLocalFile("Adapty \(level): \(message)")
}
```
