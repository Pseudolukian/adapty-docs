metadataTitle: "Amazon S3 Integration for Exporting Adapty Events and Paywall Views"
---

[Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a scalable, high-speed, web-based cloud storage service designed for online backup and archiving of data and application programs. It is part of Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

Amazon S3 is used for a variety of purposes, including data storage, backup and archiving, content storage and delivery, big data analytics, and disaster recovery.

With Amazon S3 integrated, you can do this:

1. Export Adapty events and paywall views to Amazon S3 bucket as CSV files.
2. Use the exported data for a wide range of purposes, including detailed analytics, predictions, or behavior analysis.

**Integration characteristics for automatic periodic export**

| Integration characteristic | Description |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| Schedule | Adapty sends your data every 24 hours at 4:00 UTC. |
| Data sending format | <p>CSV files with all Adapty events of selected types or all paywall views.</p><p></p><p>Each file contains data for the events or paywall views created for the entire previous calendar day in UTC. For example, the data exported automatically at 4:00 UTC on March 8th will contain all the events or paywall views created on March 7th from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 in UTC.</p> |
| Data direction | One-way data transmission: from Adapty to Amazon S3 storage. You can set up separate destinations—one for events and another for paywall views. |
| Adapty integration flow | Events and paywall views are sent by the Adapty server by schedule |


**Integration characteristics for manual export**

| Integration characteristic | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Schedule                   | Not scheduled. The data is exported upon the user's request.                                                                                    |
| Data sending format        | CSV file with all Adapty events of selected types or with all paywall views for a custom period of time defined by the user                     |
| Data direction             | One-way data transmission: from Adapty to Amazon S3 storage. You can set up separate destinations—one for events and another for paywall views. |
| Adapty integration flow    | Events and paywall views are sent by the Adapty server upon the user's request.                                                                 |

## Export file structure

Whether you export Adapty events or paywalls, manually or automatically by schedule, you will get a table with an exact list of columns. Of course, the columns will differ for events and paywall views

:::warning
Note that this structure may grow over time — with new data being introduced by us or by the 3rd parties we work with. Make sure that your code that processes it is robust enough and relies on the specific fields, but not on the structure as a whole.
