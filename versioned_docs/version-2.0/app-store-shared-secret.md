:::warning
This is a legacy receipt verification method

You only need to configure this shared secret if you're on Apple's StoreKit \<v2.0 and Adapty SDK \<v.2.9.0 â€” as it is currently deprecated by Apple.

If you're just starting out with Adapty, configure [Apple In-App Purchase API](in-app-purchase-api-storekit-2) instead.
:::

Adapty uses this key for receipt verification. This key is app-specific, make sure to generate it for each of your apps. To do this please follow the steps below.

:::note
You can also generate one Primary Shared Secret, and use one key for all your apps. To generate it, go to Users and Access > [Shared Secret](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/shared-secret) page and click **Generate** there.
:::

## 1\. Generate a shared secret for your app

Select your app on the [App Store Connect apps page](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps). Go to **App Information** in section **General**. On the page, you can see the App-Specific Shared Secret description with  **Manage** link below, click it, and you'll be able to see or create a new shared secret.

  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>





Generate a Shared Secret, copy it, and don't forget to paste it in Adapty Dashboard.

    width: '700px', /* image width */

  }}
