With Adapty, you can create and run paywalls and A/B tests at different points in your app user's journey, such as Onboarding, Settings, etc. These points are called Placements. A placement in your app can manage multiple paywalls or A/B tests at a time, each made for a certain group of users, which we call Audiences. Moreover, you can experiment with paywalls, replacing one with another over time without releasing a new app version.

The only thing you hardcode in the mobile app is the placement ID.

<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/audience.jpg').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

When you combine all the power of Adapty and FlutterFlow, you take the best from both solutions: you design the paywall UI using FlutterFlow's rich features. In parallel, you [create the same paywall](create-paywall) in the Adapty Dashboard. You don't need to design the UI in Adapty, but be sure to add the products you want to sell on the paywall. Ensure that the paywall you design in FlutterFlow matches the number of products in the Adapty paywall.

Once you've created a paywall in the Adapty Dashboard, please [create a placement](create-placement) and [add your paywall](add-audience-paywall-ab-test) to it. Adapty's placement system allows you to experiment with different paywalls and A/B tests, swapping one out for another over time without needing to release a new app version.

Before proceeding, make sure you've done the following:

1. [Created at least one paywall and added at least one product to it](create-paywall) in the Adapty Dashboard.
2. [Created at last one placement](create-placement) and [added your paywall to it](add-audience-paywall-ab-test) in the Adapty Dashboard.
3. And finally added the Adapty Plugin as a dependency in your FlutterFlow project as described below.

<details>
   <summary>Add the Adapty Plugin as a dependency (click to expand)</summary>
1. In your project, click **Settings and Integrations** ifrom the left menu.
<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./FF_img/main_settings.png').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>
2. In the **App Settings** section on the left, select **Project dependencies**.
<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./FF_img/settings_dependencies.png').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>
3. In the **Project Dependencies** window, click the **Add Dependency** button.

<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./FF_img/add-dependency.png').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>
4. From the list, choose **Adapty FF Plugun**.
<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./FF_img/select_adapty_plugin.png').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

4. Click the **Add** button.

The Adapty FF Plugin will now be added as a dependency to your project. In the **Adapty FF Plugin** window, youâ€™ll find all the Adapty resources that have been imported into your project.
</details>

After completing these steps, you'll be able to call your paywall in your FlutterFlow app and enable purchases through it.

## What's next? 

- Fetch paywall: At this stage we will create a variable for a paywall and link it to the `AdaptyPaywall`. After that we will create an action block that will start on user's page load and will request Adapty paywall to the new variable and handle if any.
- Fetch paywall data: At this stage we will create a new page for a paywall, create a parameter for paywall, create a variable for products received from Adapty paywall, and then create an action block that will start on user's page load and will request Adapty paywall products to the new variable and handle errors if any.
