The integration of Adapty with [Firebase](firebase-and-google-analytics) enables you to enrich your data and optimize your **Google Ads** campaigns by leveraging [Adapty events](events). Additionally, you can use this integration to launch interest-based advertising. With Adapty, you can gain valuable insights into user behavior and improve your campaign targeting, driving better results for your business.

### 1. Integrate Firebase with Adapty

 To begin leveraging the benefits of Google Ads, the initial step is to establish the connection between your Firebase Account and Adapty. You can refer to the Firebase integration [documentation](firebase-and-google-analytics) for more details. Please also make sure that you have configured the[ Mobile SDK](firebase-and-google-analytics#sdk-configuration) for this integration. 

### 2. Connect the Firebase project with your Google Ads account

The next step is to connect your Google Ads account with your Firebase project. For that you'll need to follow these four steps:


<img
  src={require('./img/458e843-07c949af-d174-461d-b3d8-e9825b6b1896.jpg').default}
  style={{
    border: 'none', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>





1. Access the settings menu for your Firebase project.
2. Navigate to the Integrations tab.
3. Link your Google Ads account with your Firebase project. Check [this document](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6383833#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) for more detailed instructions.
4. Once linked, go to the Events tab and activate the "Mark as conversion" switch for the Adapty events row. For this step you can find  more detailed information  in the following documentation pages: [Target audiences using Firebase data](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6398643), [Use Firebase events as conversion events in Google Ads](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6366292), and [Enable Firebase events as conversions.](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6317522#enable&zippy=%2Cin-this-article)

By completing these steps, you can take advantage of Adapty's integration with Firebase to optimize your Google Ads campaigns and target audiences using Firebase data. You can efficiently handle subscription purchases and renewals and enhance your ad performance by optimizing campaigns based on Adapty's rich [event list.](events) This integration allows you to maximize the potential of your ad campaigns and drive better results.
