Mobile applications with annual revenues in the Google Play Store below a $1M threshold are eligible for discounts on the store commission. Such a discount program is called [Google's Reduced Service Fee](google-reduced-service-fee) for applications in Google Play. Adapty can accurately calculate your app's earnings by deducting Google's commission and taking into account your eligibility for the program. For that, indicate that your mobile application is participating in one or both discount programs and specify the participation periods. 

You can do it doing the initial onboarding or change it later in the **App Settings** of the Adapty Dashboard.

## Record participation in the reduced store fee program in the App settings

You can adjust the participation dates for your mobile app in the [Google's Reduced Service Fee program](google-reduced-service-fee) at any time as needed, even if you initially recorded them during setup. 

1. Open the [**App settings**](https://app.adapty.io/settings/android-sdk) from the Adapty top menu.

3. Click the **Apply** button to save your changes and close the calendar.
4. Repeat the above steps as necessary for another app store.

Once you've finished indicating discount programs, click the **Continue** button. This action will open the **App Store configuration** window.
