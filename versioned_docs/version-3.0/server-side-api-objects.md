## Objects

Adapty API has JSON objects so you can understand a response structure and wrap it into your code.

All datetime values are [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), for example, "2020-01-15T15:10:36.517975+0000".

### Access level

Info about customerâ€™s [access level](access-level). 

Access levels let you control what your app's users can do in your mobile app without hardcoding specific product IDs. Each product defines how long the user gets a certain access level. So, whenever a user makes a purchase, Adapty grants access to the app for a specific period (for subscriptions) or forever (for lifetime purchases). Alternatively, you can [grant specific access](server-side-api-specs#grant-access-level) for a specified time to a user via server-side API.

You can do the following action via Adapty server-side API:

- [Check users's access level](server-side-api-specs#retrieve-profile) by retrieving their profile details
- [Grant specific access](server-side-api-specs#grant-access-level) to your end user without providing a transaction
- [Set transaction and grant access level](server-side-api-specs#set-transaction) to your end user
- [Revoke access level](server-side-api-specs#revoke-access-level) from your end user
