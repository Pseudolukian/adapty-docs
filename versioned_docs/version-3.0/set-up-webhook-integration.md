Adapty [webhook integration](webhook) consists of the following steps:

1. You set up your endpoint:
   1.  To [have the **Content-Type** header as `application/json`](set-up-webhook-integration#set-up-your-server-to-process-adapty-events). 
   2. To [receive the first Adapty verification request](set-up-webhook-integration#adaptys-verification-request) - the initial request to verify the connection is set up correctlyÑŽ
   3. And after that to [response](set-up-webhook-integration#your-servers-verification-response) to it for the Adapty server to learn the connection is successfully established.
   4. To [receive the standard events and process them](set-up-webhook-integration#adapty-standard-event-request).

2. [You configure the integration](set-up-webhook-integration#configure-webhook-integration-in-the-adapty-dashboard) in the Adapty Dashboard. Within this step, you can optionally [map Adapty events with your event names](set-up-webhook-integration#choose-events-to-send-and-map-event-names). We recommend to first use the Sandbox environment to test how your server processes Adapty events and after you make sure it does it as expected, switch to the production environment 
3. Adapty sends a verification request to your server.
4. Your server sends a verification response to Adapty.
5. After the Adapty server receives the verification response in the expected format, it's ready to send standard event requests.
6. [Test your webhook integration](test-webhook).

## Step 1. Set up your server to process Adapty requests

Please set up your endpoint to have the **Content-Type** header as `application/json` , i.e. your server's endpoint should expect the incoming webhook request to have its payload formatted as JSON.

Adapty will send to your webhook endpoint 2 types of requests:

1. [**Verification request**](set-up-webhook-integration#adaptys-verification-request): the initial request to verify the connection is set up correctly. This request will not contain any event and will be sent the moment you click the **Save** button in the Webhook integration of the Adapty Dashboard. To confirm your endpoint successfully received the verification request, your endpoint should answer with a [verification response](set-up-webhook-integration#your-servers-verification-response).
2. [**Usual event**](set-up-webhook-integration#webhook-event-structure): A standard request Adapty server sends every time an event is created in it. You server does not need to  reply with any specific responce. The only thing the Adapty server needs is to receive a standard 200-code HTTP responce if it successfully received the message.

## Step 2. Set up receiving Adapty's verification request by your server

After you enable webhook integration in the Adapty Dashboard, Adapty will automatically send a `isMount` POST verification request to your endpoint.

```json title="Json"
{
    adapty_check: {{check_string}}
}
```

:::note
Be sure your endpoint supports **Content-Type**: `application/json` header.
:::

## Step 3. Set up your server's verification response

Your server must reply with a 200 or 201 HTTP status code and send the response outlined below with the identical `check_string`. 

```json title="Json"
{
    adapty_check_response: {{check_string}}
}
```

Once Adapty receives the verification response in the correct format, your Adapty webhook integration is fully configured.

From then on, Adapty will send the selected events to your specified URL as they happen. Ensure your server promptly confirms each Adapty event with a response status code in the 200-404 range, the `check_string` is not required anymore.

## Step 4. Set up processing of Adapty standard events

### Webhook event structure

Adapty will send you those events you've chosen in the **Events names** section of the [**Integrations** ->  **Webhooks**](https://app.adapty.io/integrations/customwebhook) page.

Webhook events are serialized in JSON. The body of a `POST` request to your server will contain the serialized event wrapped into the following structure:

```json title="Json"
{
  "profile_id": "772204ce-ebf6-4ed9-83b0-d8633ab62b01",
  "customer_user_id": "john.doe",

#### Event properties for all events exept for the Access Level Updated event
Event properties can differ between events. For example, for Access Level Updated event they differ pretty much, so we've deparated them to a separate section Event properties for Access Level Updated event. Event properties for other events are nearly the same, so we provide them as one table with highlighting if the property belons to some specific event.

## Step 5. Configure webhook integration in the Adapty Dashboard

Within Adapty, you can configure separate flows for production events and test events received from the Apple or Stripe sandbox environment or Google test account. 

For production events, use the **Production endpoint URL** field specifying the URL to which the callbacks will be sent. Additionally, configure the **Authorization header value for production endpoint** field - the header for your server to authenticate Adapty events. Note that we'll use the value specified in the **Authorization header value for production endpoint** field as the `Authorization` header exactly as provided, without any changes or additions.

For test events, employ the  **Sandbox endpoint URL** and **Authorization header value for sandbox endpoint** fields accordingly.

To set up the webhook integration:

1. Open [**Integrations** -> **Webhook**](https://app.adapty.io/integrations/customwebhook) in your Adapty Dashboard.


<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/a3e49a8-webhook_integration.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>


2. Turn on the toggle to initiate the integration.
3. Fill out the integration fields:

| Field | Description |
|-----|-----------|
| **Production endpoint URL** | URL that is used by Adapty to send HTTP POST requests to this URL when events occur. |
| **Authorization header value for production endpoint** | <p>The header that your server will use to authenticate requests from Adapty in production. Note that we'll use the value specified in this field as the `Authorization` header exactly as provided, without any changes or additions.</p><p></p><p>Although not mandatory, it's strongly recommended for enhanced security.</p> |

   Additionally, for your testing needs in the staging environment, two other fields are available:

| Testing field | Description |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Sandbox endpoint URL** | Adapty will use this URL to send HTTP POST requests when events occur in the staging environment. |
| **Authorization header value for sandbox endpoint** | <p>The header that your server will use to authenticate requests from Adapty during testing in the sandbox environment. Note that we'll use the value specified in this field as the `Authorization` header exactly as provided, without any changes or additions.</p><p></p><p>Although not mandatory, it's strongly recommended for enhanced security.</p> |
4. Choose the events you want to receive and [map their names](set-up-webhook-integration#choose-events-to-send-and-map-event-names).
5. Additional fields and options are not obligatory; use them as needed. 
6. Remember to click the **Save** button to confirm the changes.

Please note that the moment you click the **Save** button, Adapty will send a verification request and will wait for your server verification response.

## Step 6. (optional) Choose events to send and map event names

Choose the events you want to receive in your server by enabling the toggle next to it. If your event IDs differ from those used in Adapty and keep the IDs in your system as is and replace the default Adapty event IDs with yours in the **Events names** section of the [**Integrations** ->  **Webhooks**](https://app.adapty.io/integrations/customwebhook) page.

<Zoom>
  <img src={require('./img/86942b8-event_names_renaming.webp').default}
  style={{
    border: '1px solid #727272', /* border width and color */
    width: '700px', /* image width */
    display: 'block', /* for alignment */
    margin: '0 auto' /* center alignment */
  }}
/>
</Zoom>

The event ID can be any string, simply make sure the event ID in your webhook processing server coinside with the one you eneterd in the Adapty Dashboard. You cannot leave the event ID empty for enabled events. If you accidentally removed Adapty event ID and need to restore it, you can always copy it from the **Webhook events** table below.

### Webhook events

| Event Name                         | Default event ID                   | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Subscription started               | subscription_started               | A user has activated a paid subscription without a trial period i.e. he was billed instantly. |
| Subscription renewed               | subscription_renewed               | A subscription was renewed and the user was charged. For both trial and non-trial subscriptions, this event is sent starting from the second billing. |
| Subscription renewal cancelled     | subscription_renewal_cancelled     | A user turned off subscription auto-renewal. A user still has access to the premium features of your app until the end of the paid subscription period. |
| Subscription renewal reactivated   | subscription_renewal_reactivated   | A user turned on subscription auto-renewal.                  |
| Subscription expired (churned)     | subscription_expired               | A user has canceled a subscription and it is completely finished. For example, if a user has a subscription till the 31st of December a cancells the subscription on 12th of December, the event will be created on the 31st of December when the subscription expires. |
| Subscription paused (Android only) | subscription_paused                | User activated [subscription pause](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/subs#pause) (Android only). |
| Non-subscription purchase          | non_subscription_purchase          | Any non-subscription purchase e.g. lifetime access or consumable product such as coins in a game. |
| Trial started                      | trial_started                      | A user has activated a trial subscription.                   |
| Trial converted                    | trial_converted                    | A trial period has ended and the user was billed, i.e. first purchase was made. Fro example, if a user has a 2-week trial subscription till the 14th of January and buys a paid subscription on the 7th of January, the event will be created when the user is billed - on the 7th of January. |
| Trial renewal cancelled            | trial_renewal_cancelled            | A user turned off subscription auto-renewal during the trial. A user still has access to the premium features of your app until the end of the trial period. But the subscription will not start and the user will not be billed. |
| Trial renewal reactivated          | trial_renewal_reactivated          | A user turned on subscription auto-renewal during the trial period. |
| Trial expired                      | trial_expired                      | A trial has expired without converting to a subscription.    |
| Entered grace period               | entered_grace_period               | The payment was not successful and the user entered into a grace period if you have it. The user still has access to the premium features of your app until the grace period is finished. |
| Billing issue detected             | billing_issue_detected             | An attempt to charge the user was made, but a billing issue happened. Usually, it means the user doesn't have enough card balance. |
| Subscription refunded              | subscription_refunded              | A subscription was refunded \(e.g. by Apple support\).       |
| Non-subscription purchase refunded | non_subscription_purchase_refunded | Non-subscription purchase was refunded.                      |
| Access level updated               | access_level_updated               | User's access level updated.                                 |

## Step 7. Handle webhook events

Webhooks are typically delivered within 5 to 60 seconds of the event occurring. Cancellation events, however, may take up to 2 hours to be delivered after a user cancels their subscription.

If your server's response status code is outside the 200-404 range, Adapty will retry sending the event up to 9 times over 24 hours with exponential backoff. We suggest you set up your webhook to do only basic validation of the event body from Adapty before responding. If your server can't process the event and you don't want Adapty to retry, use a status code within the 200-404 range. Also, handle any time-consuming tasks asynchronously and respond to Adapty quickly. If Adapty doesn't receive a response within 10 seconds, it will consider the attempt a failure and will retry
